            <div class="material">
                <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>✤ An oversized button-up shirt (look for one that reaches your knees or longer)</li>
                    <li>✤ Scissors</li>
                    <li>✤ Fabric chalk or marker</li>
                    <li>✤ Measuring tape</li>
                    <li>✤ Pins</li>
                    <li>✤ Sewing machine or needle and thread</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mark the Ruffle Sections: Decide how many layers of ruffles you want for your dress. You’ll
                    typically need two or three. Starting from the bottom hem, mark where each section will go, leaving
                    space in between for a clean, gathered look. Use fabric chalk or a marker to outline these areas.
                </li>
                <li>Cut the Bottom Sections: Cut horizontally along your marked lines, separating each ruffle section
                    from the main shirt. Set these aside – they’ll become your ruffles later.</li>
                <li>Shape the Bodice: Now, focus on the top part of the shirt, which will become the bodice of your
                    dress. If the shirt has sleeves, remove them by cutting along the shoulder seams, then shape the
                    armholes to your liking. You may also want to taper the sides of the shirt a bit for a more fitted
                    look.</li>
                <li>Gather the Ruffles: Take each section you cut earlier and use a basting stitch (a long, loose
                    stitch) along the top edge of each piece. Gently pull the thread to gather the fabric until it’s
                    slightly smaller than the width of the main bodice. Adjust the gathers to be even.</li>
                <li>Attach the Ruffles: Pin each gathered ruffle layer to the bottom of the bodice, starting with the
                    lowest one first, and sew them into place. Make sure to overlap each ruffle section slightly for a
                    layered effect.</li>
                <li>Add Finishing Touches: Try on your dress to check the fit. Make any adjustments around the armholes
                    or neckline, if needed. Hem the raw edges of each ruffle layer to prevent fraying and give a clean
                    finish.</li>
            </ol>
