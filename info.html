      <h1>Learn about swapping & upcycling ðŸŒŽ</h1>
      <h2>Garment swapping</h2>
      <p>Garment swapping is shopping â€“ without the spending! Hereâ€™s how it works: bring in clothes youâ€™re ready to let
        go of, and in return, pick out some fresh finds from others in the community. Itâ€™s like a treasure hunt but
        sustainable. You get to mix up your style, meet new people, and give great pieces a new home. So, ditch fast
        fashion and join the swap cycle; letâ€™s keep Amsterdam looking good and green!</p>

      <h2>Garment upcycling</h2>
      <p>Upcycling is like giving your clothes a second life â€“ but way cooler. Itâ€™s all about transforming pieces you
        already own (or find) into something fresh and fabulous. Picture a well-worn denim jacket turning into a funky
        tote bag or a shirt becoming a stylish crop top. Upcycling isnâ€™t just recycling; itâ€™s about upgrading! Every
        time you upcycle, youâ€™re keeping old fabrics out of the trash and bringing one-of-a-kind items into your closet.
        Win-win, right?
