            <h1>Denim Bag</h1>

            <div class="material">
                <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>✤ A pair of old jeans (preferably wide-legged for more fabric)</li>
                    <li>✤ Fabric for the lining (cotton works well, in any color or pattern you like)</li>
                    <li>✤ Scissors</li>
                    <li>✤ Sewing machine or needle and thread</li>
                    <li>✤ Pins</li>
                    <li>✤ Fabric chalk or marker</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut Out the Denim Pieces: Start by cutting a large oval or rounded rectangle from one jean leg. This
                    will be the main body of your hobo bag, so make it as big as you want the bag to be. You’ll need two
                    identical pieces for the front and back.
                </li>
                <li>Cut the Lining Pieces: Using the denim pieces as a guide, cut two matching pieces from your lining
                    fabric. These will go inside the bag to add durability and style.
                </li>
                <li>Create Inner Pockets: For small inner pockets, cut two smaller rectangles from the lining fabric or
                    remaining denim. Each rectangle should be big enough for essentials like a phone or keys (about 10cm
                    x
                    15cm, but adjust based on your needs).
                </li>
                <li>Attach the Inner Pockets: Take one of the lining pieces, and place the pocket rectangles where you’d
                    like them. Pin each pocket in place and sew along the sides and bottom edges, leaving the top open.
                    This creates functional pockets on the inside of your bag.
                </li>
                <li>Create the Handle: Cut a long strip from the jean leg (around 10cm wide and 70cm long) for the hobo
                    bag’s handle. Fold the strip in half lengthwise with the right side facing out, and sew along the
                    edge
                    to form a sturdy handle.
                </li>
                <li>Assemble the Outer Bag: Place the two denim pieces together with the right sides facing in, and sew
                    along the edges, leaving the top open. This will create the rounded hobo bag shape.
                </li>
                <li>Attach the Lining: Sew the two lining pieces together along the sides and bottom, leaving the top
                    open.
                    Keep the lining inside out so the seams are hidden inside the bag.
                </li>
                <li>Combine Lining and Outer Bag: Turn the denim bag right-side out and place the lining inside, with
                    the
                    wrong side of the lining facing out. Make sure the top edges of the lining and the denim are
                    aligned.
                    Pin them together along the top edge.
                </li>
                <li>Sew the Handle and Top Edge: Insert each end of the handle between the outer denim layer and the
                    lining
                    at the top edges of the bag, about 5cm from each side. Pin in place. Sew around the top edge of the
                    bag, attaching the handle and securing the lining in one go.
                </li>
                <li>Finishing Touches: Flip the lining inside the bag and press down the top seam to give it a clean
                    finish. Add any final touches like decorative patches or pins.
                </li>
            </ol>
